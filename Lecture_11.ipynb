    "\n",
    "The single most often used real-world discrete model. Applicable when there are a _large number of trials_ with a _small probability of success in each trial_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the probability of success in each trial does _not_ have to be the same in each trial (unlike $Bin(n,p)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space, if these events occur with a known average _rate_ and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.\n",

    "Examples might be counting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- e-mails coming into your mailbox in an hour\n",
    "- buses following the same route arriving at a bus-stop in a day\n",
