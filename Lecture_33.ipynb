    "## Generalizing Reversible Markov Chains\n",

    "Now let's take what we learned about undirected graphs and reversible Markov chains, and extend that just a bit more: let's assume that the transition probabilities are not uniform for a node, that some edges are more likely to be traversed than others (but still keeping to an undirected graph). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the degree for node is the number of edges it has. We proved last time that the stationary probability for any node is proportional to its degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will generalize that to deal with edge weights: $w_{ij} \\ge 0, w_{ij} = 0$ if there is no edge $\\{ij\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the graph in question is undirected, assume $w_{ij} = w_{ji}$.\n",

In the case of no weights, just think of all the weights as being 1; hence, the transition probabilities are proportional to degree.\n",

    "Let a web page's score be $s_j = \\sum_i s_i \\, q_{ij}$. Now all the links a page might have should be \"diluted\" equally, and so that is what the $q_{ij}$ is doing the previous equation.\n",

    "  Q &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n",

    "There are now _two_ transition matrices: $Q$ for clicking links to pages on the web; and $\\frac{J}{M}$ matrix for \"teleporting\" to another page. So, with probability $\\alpha$ the web surfer will follow a link from the present page to another, and with probability $1-\\alpha$ the surfer will jump to another page (with all pages equally probable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that with the above formula irreducibility is guaranteed, as all transition probabilities are greater than 0. And since this is an irreducible Markov chain, a unique stationary distribution does exist.\n",

    "Eigen computations on a matrix with a rank of this magnitude could very well be computationally unfeasible, but if we use a Markov model and agree that we do _not_ need the exact stationary distribution but only an _approximation_, then we can use property of convergence to stationarity to find a reasonable answer!\n",
