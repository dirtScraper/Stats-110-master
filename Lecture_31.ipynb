    "## What are Markov chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains are an example of a stochastic process, or sequences of random variables evolving over the dimension of time or space. They were invented or discovered by Markov as way to answer the question _Does free will exist?_ However, their application is very wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a sequence of random variables $X_0, X_1, X_2, \\cdots$. In our studies up until now, we were assuming that the distributions of these random variables were _independent and individually distributed_. If the index represents time, then this is like starting with a fresh, new independent random variable at each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting case is when the random variables are in some way related. But in assuming such a case, the relations can get very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains are a compromise: they are one level of complexity beyond _i.i.d._, and they come with some very useful properties. For example, think of $X_n$ as the state of a system at a particular and discrete time, like that for a wandering partical jumping from state to state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes or states can be with regards to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* discrete time\n",
    "* continuous time\n",
    "* discrete space\n",
    "* continuous space\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple introduction, we will limit ourselves to the case of _discrete time, with a finite number of states_ (discrete space), where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$."

    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a Markov chain as a model to describe a system evolving over time. The case of $P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i) = q_{ij}$ only looks at the present $X_n$, ignoring events of the past. Using such a *first order* model might be too strong a starting assumption of conditional independence. We could, however, extend this model such that $P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i, X_{n-1} = k)$, to consider the last 2 states (second order), or even more past states.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also such things called Markov Chain Monte Carlo, where you synthesize your own Markov Chain to let you do large-scale simulations (computer-assisted, of course). \n",
    "\n",
    "But originally, Markov came up with this idea to show there was a way to reconcile the Law of Large Numbers but relax the condition of _independent, individually distributed_, and instead of completely ignoring the past states of system, condition on the present state (first-order) to predict the future. Of course, this could be extended to condition on states prior to the present as well. He wanted to go a step beyond _i.i.d._. His  experiment was with the Russian langage and its vowels and consonants, a chain of two states."
